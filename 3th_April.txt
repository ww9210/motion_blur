1. Trying to get and store the motion vector in the BestCU
	step1: modify the class TComDataCU and add two fields, one for the motion vector list(frame) indicator, and the other for the field to store the motion vector searched by function "predInterSearch".

	step2: modify the function "predInterSearch" to store the mv and the reflist number in the added fields of rpcTempCU

	step3: modify the function "xCheckBestMode" to store the motion vector and the reflist number in the fields of rpcBestCU

2. See Laude's predInterSearch code

3. The function of PredInterSearch is to search for the best candidate for inter prediciton in rpcBestCU, then the candidate will be blurred in a reference picture list and search motion vector again in a new function.

4. After getting the information of mv in rpcBestCU, we need to blur the reference region(larger area should be blurred due to possible shifting after convolution) and store it as a reference frame with other region set to 0. Then do a second search in the added reference frame for the best motion vector(where to store the second motion vector?), the difference between the two motion vector search should be stored later.

5. Question: 
	1) what is mvD? 
	2) should it be recorded?
	3) Why store the mv in rpcBest even the cost of temp is worse than current best?
    4) In the matlab code the second search is done in the function blur_Compensation, where to do second search in the  HM code
