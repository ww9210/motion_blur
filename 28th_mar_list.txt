implementation of Intersection Kernel for blur;

try nonlinear filter;

try the code of "Analyzing motion varying blur";

read and debug the source code of "myblockmatcher.cpp";

investigate the relationship between motion vector size and objects;

Variable intersection kernel length(1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5) was used for blur compensatation 

draw flagmap of kernel 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5

compare SE of search motion vector for only once and twice

compare SE of using intersection and fspecial filter

compare SE of using variable length fspecial kernel
